# TiltShift
Tilt Shift Image Effect with OpenCL.  A final project for CS205.

In this project, we provide code to perform image manipulations, including Box Blur, as well as Saturation and Contrast adjustments.  Taken together, these effects can be combined to produce images which appear to be Tilt Shifted.

We provide code to perform these effects in both standard Python and OpenCL, which runs on GPUs.
